# üß† AI Algorithms for Classic Games and Puzzles

This repository contains implementations of AI algorithms to solve two classic and intellectually engaging problems. These projects were completed as part of our undergraduate coursework (COMP 569: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) to explore search strategies, game theory, and optimization techniques in Artificial Intelligence.

## üß© 8 Puzzle Problem

The **8 Puzzle Problem** is a classic AI challenge that involves sliding tiles on a 3√ó3 grid to reach a specified goal configuration. One tile space is blank (represented by 0), allowing adjacent tiles to move into it

**AI Techniques Used:**

Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A* Search, Greedy Best-First, and Iterative Deepening Search.

This problem highlights state-space search, heuristics, and algorithm trade-offs in solving combinatorial puzzles.

## ‚ôüÔ∏è 8 Queens Problem

The **8 Queens Problem** involves placing eight queens on an 8√ó8 chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other. In other words, no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

**AI Techniques Used:**


This problem is a fundamental example of constraint satisfaction and demonstrates how AI can be applied to systematically explore solution spaces.

## ‚ùå‚≠ï Tic-Tac-Toe

**Tic-Tac-Toe** is a simple but classic two-player game where the goal is to place three marks (X or O) in a row‚Äîhorizontally, vertically, or diagonally‚Äîon a 3√ó3 grid.

**AI Techniques Used:**

This implementation allows the AI to play optimally against a human opponent, either as X or O.
